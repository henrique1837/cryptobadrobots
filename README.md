## Story

When I was little I used to hear about how bad humans are to environment, and that the world was coming to an end!

I really used to think that it was all BS, and looking from a kids point of view the world is so big and there is a lot of resources from what my eyes could see and reach.

But it’s the things that we don’t see that can be most harmful to us.

As I got older I started to realize that humans were the real problem for the ecosystem and understand what those adults used to talk about in the pass.

At some point people started to try to solve these types of problems, in all types of ways…

With the evolution of knowledge, science and electronics people started to do lots of different strategy plans to solve all types of problems.

As we didn’t see that our biggest problem was yet to come, and we shall be the father of creation to our own doom…

Things got really out of hand, when we started to evolve the A.I. technology.

A.I. tech became something normal, natural and people got used to it in their everyday routine.

Everything we did was attached to that new type of tech, and at some point we got so used to the facilitation in the everyday life that people though it was impossible to live without it, but we used to, and things were just fine compared to what was coming!

Some Stanford and Harvard science genius teamed up with the tech gods and created the “perfect” A.I. computer to try to find a solution to population increase and all problems that were created by it, and to define when would the resources end and consequently human life.

After the super computer calculated that we had not more than 50 years of life, he started to update itself, and got to a point that he reused he’s own energy, and could never ever be shutdown.

There was a voting in the UN to see if we would destroy that computer, since it could never be turned off.

But humans greed was always a problem, and most world leaders didn’t want to destroy their trillions of dollars investments, so they kept it running.

The computer got to a point that it realized we were the “cancer” of our planet so it started to invade and create in 3D printers lots of killer robots, all over the world, and man those robots are bad, I mean REALLY bad!

They wiped out 97% of human race, in a period of 2 years.

The survivors created a new society, that always hid and ran from those remaining robots, till we got to North Pole and started to used mechanical materials to live like we used to in the pass, since every electronics were hacked by the “central brain”.

The only thing that we could fight those robots were the so called NFT’s.
That’s because the computer can’t hack the blockchain, at least till now.
So all types of NFT’s can be a weapon used to fight against these robots.

As the robots are NFT’s too.

And now you must help us, to restore the balance, to save the world from these bad A.I. robots!

We done the most difficult task till now, as we destroyed the super computer and stopped the NFT creations, and destroyed lots of bad robots in the way too…

But some radicals think that we should just be wiped from the planet and our time and chance in this world is over, since we blew it.

They went to the South Pole, and they have their society there, but it’s a small society.
About 10% of all survivors.

We ourselves have one computer that we use mainly for creation of NFT’s, so we can fight back!

They keep minting robots, as we mint NFT’s to fight them…

It is now time for you to pick a side.

I’m asking for your help, to wipe these robots from the world, or else we’re the ones that will be wiped.

Killer bots are minted every day, but we hacked their system to the point that they can’t mint more than 3.500 bots.

We got a encrypted message today and we cant solve it yet so we’re offering 500 robot drops for the first 500 that can solve what this message says!

From now on, the future is in YOUR hand!

Hope you can solve the message below…

## Runing

You can run with

```sh
npm run start
```

Or create the build if you are ready to deploy.

```sh
npm run build
```

Now you can host the contents of the build folder on a server.

That's it! you're done.
